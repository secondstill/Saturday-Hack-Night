## How it Works ?
We can input a loooooooong url (say 100000 characters in length) and get a smol url with a unique key consisting of 11 special characters. Small but a very effective project to explore django and the databases part of it is the main priority here. Mapping the original url (ogurl) with the database, creating a slug (our unique key here) and returning the short url back to the client.
